## Contribute 

You can submit a pull request or issue to update the information you know. Once confirmed, we will update it promptly. 

We hope the listed individuals are new stars in the AI circle who have emerged in the last two years. We do not accept founders, professors, etc., who were already famous and had multiple rounds of funding before.
